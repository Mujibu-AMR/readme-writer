# Introduction #
**README** is an important documentation as it is an entry point for any project. But I am quite lazy to switch between applications to see output and also I am learning *React.js*. I thought maybe I should do this as a project and here is the result. I know it is not quite powerful. But I hope it will help someone. :)

## Requirements ##
1. npm
2. React.js
3. Browser

## Installations ##
1. Clone the project
2. Open up the *terminal* or *commandline*.
3. Navigate to the project folder.
4. Run `npm start` command.
5. The browser will open up automatically. If not, open up the browser and visit *http://localhost:3000/*
